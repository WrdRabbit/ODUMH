            <p>This directory was made by a highschool student who is passionate about mental health and who truly believes in its importance. The directory is dedicated to providing accessible, affordable, and culturally sensitive mental health resources for individuals from all backgrounds. Our goal is to make mental health support readily available and easy to navigate, helping users find the support they need based on specific issues, types of resources, and language preferences.

                The directory also uniquely focuses on including online resources rather than in person, as the world moves into a digital climate.
